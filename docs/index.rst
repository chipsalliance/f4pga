FOSS Flows For FPGA
###################

`F4PGA ➚ <https://f4pga.org/>`__, which is a Workgroup under the `CHIPS Alliance ➚ <https://chipsalliance.org>`__, is an
Open Source solution for Hardware Description Language (HDL) to Bitstream FPGA synthesis, currently targeting
Xilinx's 7-Series, QuickLogic's EOS-S3, and Lattice' iCE40 and ECP5 devices.
Think of it as the GCC of FPGAs.
The project aims to design tools that are highly extendable and multiplatform.

The elements of the project include (but are not limited to):

* The F4PGA open source FPGA toolchains for programming FPGAs (formerly known as :gh:`SymbiFlow ➚ <https://github.com/SymbiFlow>`):

  * :gh:`F4PGA Python CLI ➚ <chipsalliance/f4pga/tree/main/f4pga>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA Architecture Definitions ➚ <SymbiFlow/f4pga-arch-defs>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA Examples ➚ <chipsalliance/f4pga-examples>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA Yosys plugins ➚ <chipsalliance/yosys-f4pga-plugins>`

* The FPGA interchange format (an interchange format defined by CHIPS Alliance to enable interoperability between
  different FPGA tools) adopted by the F4PGA toolchain:

  * :gh:`FPGA Interchange schema ➚ <chipsalliance/fpga-interchange-schema>`
  * :gh:`FPGA Interchange Python utilities ➚ <chipsalliance/python-fpga-interchange>`
  * :gh:`FPGA Interchange Test suite ➚ <SymbiFlow/fpga-interchange-tests>`

* The :gh:`FPGA tool performance framework ➚ <chipsalliance/fpga-tool-perf>` framework for benchmarking
  designs against various FPGA tools, and vice versa, over time.

* FPGA visualisation tools for visual exploration of FPGA bitstream and databases:

  * :gh:`F4PGA bitstream viewer ➚ <SymbiFlow/f4pga-bitstream-viewer>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA database visualizer ➚ <chipsalliance/f4pga-database-visualizer>`

* Other utilities (FPGA assembly format, documentation and other):

  * :gh:`F4PGA Assembly (FASM) ➚ <chipsalliance/fasm>`
  * :gh:`Xilinx bitstream generation library ➚ <SymbiFlow/f4pga-xc-fasm>`
  * :gh:`Verilog-to-routing XML utilities ➚ <SymbiFlow/vtr-xml-utils>`
  * :gh:`SDF format utilities ➚ <chipsalliance/python-sdf-timing>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA tools data manager ➚ <SymbiFlow/symbiflow-tools-data-manager>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA Sphinx Theme ➚ <SymbiFlow/sphinx_symbiflow_theme>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA Sphinx HDL diagrams ➚ <SymbiFlow/sphinxcontrib-hdl-diagrams>`
  * :gh:`F4PGA Sphinx Verilog domain ➚ <SymbiFlow/sphinx-verilog-domain>`
