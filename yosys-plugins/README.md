# Yosys F4PGA Plugins

This repository contains plugins for [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git) developed as [part of the F4PGA project](https://f4pga.org).

## Design introspection plugin

Adds several commands that allow for collecting information about cells, nets, pins and ports in the design or a
selection of objects.
Additionally provides functions to convert selection on TCL lists.

Following commands are added with the plugin:

* get_cells
* get_nets
* get_pins
* get_ports
* get_count
* selection_to_tcl_list

## FASM plugin

Writes out the design's [fasm features](https://fasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) based on the parameter annotations on a
design cell.

The plugin adds the following command:

* write_fasm

## Integrate inverters plugin

Implements a pass that integrates inverters into cells that have ports with the 'invertible_pin' attribute set.

The plugin adds the following command:

* integrateinv

## Parameters plugin

Reads the specified parameter on a selected object.

The plugin adds the following command:

* getparam

## QuickLogic IOB plugin

[QuickLogic IOB plugin](./ql-iob/) annotates IO buffer cells with information from IO placement constraints.
Used during synthesis for QuickLogic EOS-S3 architecture.

The plugin adds the following command:

* quicklogic_iob

## QuickLogic QLF FPGAs plugin

[QuickLogic QLF plugin](./ql-qlf/) extends Yosys with synthesis support for `qlf_k4n8` and `qlf_k6n10` architectures.

The plugin adds the following command:

* synth_quicklogic
* ql_dsp

Detailed help on the supported command(s) can be obtained by running `help <command_name>` in Yosys.

## SDC plugin

Reads Standard Delay Format (SDC) constraints, propagates these constraints across the design and writes out the
complete SDC information.

The plugin adds the following commands:

* read_sdc
* write_sdc
* create_clock
* get_clocks
* propagate_clocks
* set_false_path
* set_max_delay
* set_clock_groups

## XDC plugin

Reads Xilinx Design Constraints (XDC) files and annotates the specified cells parameters with properties such as:

* INTERNAL_VREF
* IOSTANDARD
* SLEW
* DRIVE
* IN_TERM
* LOC
* PACKAGE_PIN

The plugin adds the following commands:

* read_xdc
* get_iobanks
* set_property
* get_bank_tiles

## SystemVerilog plugin

Reads SystemVerilog and UHDM files and processes them into yosys AST.

The plugin adds the following commands:

* read_systemverilog
* read_uhdm

Detailed help on the supported command(s) can be obtained by running `help <command_name>` in Yosys.
